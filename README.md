# Family.mash

Gone are the days of forgetting the annivesaries and birthdays of your family members. Users of Family.mash enter their loved one's basic information and the app will send users timely email reminders to send them best wishes.

#### Motivation

This app was inspired by the younger-generation's mass-exodus from Facebook and all the birthdays that have since gone by without well-wishes being received due to former Facebook users no longer being notified of their friend's and family's upcoming birthdays.

But wait- there's more! As an added bonus, anniversary reminders have also been added for those user's family members who are either married or in a long term-relationship that merits a celebratory phone call once a year.
